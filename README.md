# Sensor-Equipment-Problem
Do each of these groups show a connection with the occurrence or not of anomalies at different times?

#Problem Statement
The attached dataset describes the time production of 3 fluids (labeled as liquid 1 , liquid 2 and
liquid 3 ) due to different concentrations of chemical X for each of the multiple sensor devices
(here identified by the Device ID number). Provided certain levels of liquid production and
chemical concentration, a test is performed to check sensor anomalies in a monthly basis (i.e.,
the Passed attribute); if passed is true, the sensor did not show anomalies, otherwise there are
indications of anomalies. The data reported in this experiment does not include a list of other
attributes that have either been purposely fixed due to its little relevance or not being disclosed
by the sensor providers.

#Objective

#1) Clean the data and perform data exploration to detect individual trends and joint
relationships among attributes.

#2) Group sensor devices considering the three liquids produced and the concentration of
chemical X every month after 6 months. Do each of these groups show a connection
with the occurrence or not of anomalies at different times?

#3) Build a predictive classification model to determine when a sensor device with a certain
level of liquid production and chemical concentration may show anomalies after a certain
number of months of operation. Pick an approach of your preference.

#4) Indicate accuracy, misclassification rate, specificity and precision of your classification
approach. Can these results be improved?

#5) (Bonus to blow out your clientâ€™s mind) Predict the production of any liquid 1,2 and 3
months after the last month of its recording. To achieve the purpose, picking one specific
type of liquid is sufficient to show the viability of the approach.
